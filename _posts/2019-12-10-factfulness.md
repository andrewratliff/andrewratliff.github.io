Hans Rosling’s 2018 book, _Factfulness_,
highlights the obligation we have to base our thinking on facts instead of
instincts. Dr. Rosling suggests that instincts tend to feed the unhelpful feelings of nostalgia and hopelessness. In fact, many
aspects of life on earth are improving. Here are four of the ten Instincts Dr. Rosling recommends we avoid:

### The Gap Instinct

The Gap Instinct leads us to understand that there is an "Us," and a "Them," when the reality isn't so binary. Third world/First world, Developing country/Developed country, East/West thinking distorts our understanding of how most people live.

Using statistics from the World Bank and the United Nations, Dr. Rosling proffers a 4 tiered framework based on income level:

#### Hans Rosling’s Framework for Looking at the World

| Income Level | Billions of People | Dollar income/day |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 1 | <2 (extreme poverty) |
| 2 | 3 | 2 - 8 |
| 3 | 2 | 8 - 32 |
| 4 | 1 | >32 |

People’s lives are dramatically different on Level 1, 2, and 3, and between these levels, the difference of a few more dollars every day is tremendous. However, if you live on Level 4, it's easy to look at everyone on Level 1, 2, and 3, and classify them all as “poor." Dr. Rosling argues that the majority of people live on [Level 2 or 3](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/){:target="_blank"}, where many educated people assume the “gap” exists.

### The Negativity Instinct

The Negativity Instinct causes us to worry that everything is bad, and getting worse, despite gradual, and sometimes drastic improvements.

Many bad realities, like hunger, child labor, and extreme poverty are decreasing. From 1800 to 2017, extreme poverty around the world decreased from 85 percent to 9 percent.

Many good realities, like literacy, vaccinations, and life expectancy are increasing. From 1800 to 2017, the average life expectancy around the world rose from 31 years to 72 years.

### The Straight Line Instinct

The Straight Line Instinct allows us to look at world population growth and think that the line will continue on the same trajectory, even though United Nations population experts predict that population growth will flatten out between [10 and 12 billion by 2100](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/900){:target="_blank"}.

However, UN global population predictions are dependent on life expectancy at birth and total fertility. If we want to [curb population growth](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/will-saving-poor-children-lead-to-overpopulation/){:target="_blank"}, we must improve the quality of life for poor families and increase the chances of their babies surviving.

### The Destiny Instinct

The Destiny Instinct makes us falsely believe that there are certain innate characteristics that determine which groups of people succeed or fail. Thinking, "that's just the way things are," is dangerous because it allows us to consider some cultures inherently more superior than others.

Cultures have always evolved and will continue to evolve. In Hans Rosling's words:

> The macho values that are found today in many Asian and African countries, these are not Asian values, or African values. They are not Muslim values. They are not Eastern values. They are patriarchal values like those found in Sweden only 60 years ago, and with social and economic progress they will vanish, just as they did in Sweden. They are not unchangeable (p. 179).
