Hans Rosling was a Swedish physician, professor of International Health, and a
co-founder of the [Gapminder Foundation](https://www.gapminder.org/){:target="_blank"}. Dr. Rosling’s 2018 book _Factfulness_
highlights the obligation we have to base our thinking on facts instead of
instincts. He suggests that we rationalize our tendencies because if left
unchecked, most of them contribute to the false idea that the world used to be
better, and even more dangerously, a sense of hopelessness. In fact, many
aspects of life on earth are improving and each individual is capable of
meaningful change. Here are four of Dr. Rosling’s ten Instincts:

### The Gap Instinct

We can’t always neatly divide complex realities: Third world/First world, Developing country/Developed country, Them/Us, East/West is no longer relevant.

Using statistics from the World Bank and the United Nations, Dr. Rosling suggests a 4 tiered framework based on income level:

#### Hans Rosling’s Framework for Looking at the World

| Income Level | Billions of People | Dollars/day |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 1 | <2 (extreme poverty) |
| 2 | 3 | 2 - 8 |
| 3 | 2 | 8 - 32 |
| 4 | 1 | >32 |

People’s lives are dramatically different on Level 1, 2, and 3. For a person living in extreme poverty on Level 1, the difference of a few more dollars every day is tremendous. However, if you live on Level 4, it is easy to look at everyone on Level 1, 2, and 3 and classify them all as “poor,” without recognizing significant differences. Dr. Rosling argues that the vast majority of people on earth live on [Level 2 or 3](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/){:target="_blank"}, where many educated people presume the “gap” to be.

### The Negativity Instinct

Many people seem to think that “things are getting worse.” Depressing images we see on the news may contribute to a negative world view, but we need to understand that a lot of positive change, especially gradual improvement, is mostly left out of the news.

Many bad realities, like hunger and child labor, are decreasing. In 1800, 85% of humanity lived in extreme poverty, on Level 1. In 2017, only 9% of humanity lived in extreme poverty.

Many good realities, like literacy and vaccinations, are increasing. In 1800, the average life expectancy around the world was 31. In 2017, the average life expectancy around the world was 72.

### The Straight Line Instinct

Over thousands of years, the human population finally reached about 1 billion people around 1800. It took just 130 more years for another billion people to be added. Then, in less than a 100 more years, another 5 billion were added. The sudden increase in human population is frightening because now we see a line rocketing upwards.

Dr. Rosling invites us to consider the growth of a human being. He shares that his youngest grandchild was 19.5 inches long when he was born. In his first six months, he grew to 26.5 inches. Seven inches of growth in half a year. We know not to panic and expect an impossibly tall human, however, because people all over the world have seen how the growth of the human body slows over the years. However, we are less familiar with global population growth. While we might worry that population growth is exploding, United Nations population experts report that population growth has already slowed down. In 1965, the average number of babies born per woman was 5. In 2017, the number had dropped to 2.5. UN experts also predict that population growth will flatten out between [10 and 12 billion by 2100](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-did-the-world-population-change/){:target="_blank"}.

I’m not completely reassured by the data. [UN World population predictions](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/900){:target="_blank"} are dependent on total fertility and life expectancy at birth. If we want to [curb population growth](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/will-saving-poor-children-lead-to-overpopulation/){:target="_blank"}, we must improve the quality of life for poor families and increase the chances of their babies surviving.

### The Destiny Instinct

We shouldn’t believe, “that’s just the way it is.” Realities change all the time.

For example: “The macho values that are found today in many Asian and African countries, these are not Asian values, or African values. They are not Muslim values. They are not Eastern values. They are patriarchal values like those found in Sweden only 60 years ago, and with social and economic progress they will vanish, just as they did in Sweden. They are not unchangeable” (Rosling, 2018, p. 179).

As realities continue to evolve, we must update our thinking. I was reminded by the 7th grader who recommended _Factfulness_ to me that a sound opinion must consider the most recent data.
