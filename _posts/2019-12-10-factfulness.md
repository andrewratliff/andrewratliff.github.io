Hans Rosling’s 2018 book, _Factfulness_,
highlights the obligation we have to base our thinking on facts instead of
instincts. Dr. Rosling suggests that instincts tend to feed the unhelpful feelings of nostalgia and hopelessness. In fact, many
aspects of life on earth are improving. Here are four of the ten Instincts Dr. Rosling recommends we avoid:

### The Gap Instinct

The Gap Instinct leads us to understand that there is an "Us," and a "Them," when the reality isn't so binary. Third world/First world, Developing country/Developed country, East/West thinking distorts our understanding of how most people live.

Dr. Rosling uses statistics from the World Bank and the United Nations to proffer a 4 tiered framework of income level:

#### Hans Rosling’s Framework to Look at the World

| Income Level | Billions of People | Dollar income/day |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | 1 | <2 (extreme poverty) |
| 2 | 3 | 2 - 8 |
| 3 | 2 | 8 - 32 |
| 4 | 1 | >32 |

People’s lives are dramatically different on Level 1, 2, and 3, and between these levels, the difference of a few more dollars every day is tremendous. However, if you live on Level 4, it's easy to look at everyone on Level 1, 2, and 3, and classify them all as “poor." Dr. Rosling argues that the majority of people live on [Level 2 or 3](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/how-many-are-rich-and-how-many-are-poor/){:target="_blank"}, where many educated people assume the “gap” exists.

### The Negativity Instinct

The Negativity Instinct causes us to worry that everything is bad, and getting worse, despite gradual, and sometimes drastic improvements.

Many bad realities, like hunger, child labor, and extreme poverty are decreasing. From 1800 to 2017, extreme poverty around the world decreased from 85 percent to 9 percent.

Literacy, vaccinations, and life expectancy are increasing. From 1800 to 2017, the average life expectancy around the world rose from 31 years to 72 years.

### The Straight Line Instinct

The Straight Line Instinct allows us to look at world population growth and think that the line will continue on the same trajectory, even though United Nations population experts predict that population growth will flatten between [10 and 12 billion by 2100](https://population.un.org/wpp/Graphs/Probabilistic/POP/TOT/900){:target="_blank"}.

However, UN global population predictions are dependent on life expectancy at birth and total fertility. If we want to [curb population growth](https://www.gapminder.org/answers/will-saving-poor-children-lead-to-overpopulation/){:target="_blank"}, we must improve the quality of life for poor families and increase the chances of their babies' survival.

### The Destiny Instinct

The Destiny Instinct makes us falsely believe that there are certain innate characteristics that determine which groups of people succeed or fail. To think, "that's just the way things are," is dangerous because it allows us to consider some cultures inherently more superior than others.

Cultures have always evolved and will continue to evolve. Dr. Rosling points out that many harmful values, such as patriarchal values, are not limited to particular regions, countries, or religions. Just as cultures all over the world exhibit patriarchal values, people all over the world have the power to foster equity.
