Malala Yousafzai became an outspoken activist for girls’ education around the age of eleven, when the Taliban came to the Swat Valley in Pakistan. The Taliban bombed a number of girls’ schools, and towards the end of 2008, finally announced that all girls’ schools would close. Malala gave television and radio interviews, wrote a blog for the BBC, and agreed to have New York Times journalist Adam Ellick film her for a documentary. In 2012, fifteen-year-old Malala was on her way home from school, when a Taliban gunman shot her in the head. Malala survived the attempted murder, and continued to advocate for girls’ education. In 2014, she became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

With the help of journalist and author, Christina Lamb, Malala published her 2013 autobiography, _I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban_. Malala’s book reveals the tremendous discrimination women in Pakistan endure - regardless of the Taliban. Her book also illustrates the mistreatment of poor people and people with dark skin. In Pakistan, discrimination based on gender, class, and skin color is evident across the generations.

# Gender

As children in the 1970s and 1980s, both of Malala’s parents experience the unequal treatment of boys and girls within their families. Malala’s mother, Toor Pekai, never learns to read or write as a child. Like the other girls in her family, she does not go to school. Malala’s father, Ziauddin, grows up in a similar family. Malala relates:


> As in most families, the girls stayed at home while the boys went to school...School wasn’t the only thing my aunts missed out on. In the morning when my father was given a bowl of cream with his tea, his sisters were given only tea. If there were eggs, they would only be for the boys…(p. 22)

Ziauddin and Toor Pekai’s families withhold education and certain types of food, among other privileges, from the girls.
The bias against girls continues when Malala comes into the world in 1997, a decade before the Taliban terrorizes the Swat Valley. Malala writes about the day she was born: “My mother was worried about telling [my father] he had a daughter not a son...” (p. 44). The preference for boys is so strong that Malala’s mother is anxious her husband will be displeased. Traditionally, families host a celebration called _Woma_, on their new baby’s seventh day of life. However, Malala’s family does not invite people to celebrate. Malala explains, “My parents had not held [a _Woma_] for me because they could not afford the goat and rice needed to feed the guests, and my grandfather would not help them out because I was not a boy” (p. 47). Two years later, Malala’s brother, Khushal, is born. Malala knows, “My mother had been waiting for a son and could not hide her joy when he was born” (p. 15). Malala’s grandfather offers to pay for the celebration of his grandson’s birth. Thus, the positive responses associated with boys, but not girls, carry into the lives of Malala and her siblings.

# Class

Like girls, poor children in Pakistan are vulnerable to contempt. As a young man, Malala’s father desperately wants to continue his own education so he won’t  “end up like his brother teaching in a local school” (p. 33). Malala explains that teachers do not want to teach at the mountain village of Sewoor, Pakistan, where her uncle works:

> The people in Sewoor were Gujars, Kohistanis and Mians. We regard Mians as noble or landed people, but Gujars and Kohistanis are what we call hilly people, peasants who look after buffaloes. Their children are usually dirty and they are looked down upon by Pashtuns, even if they are poor themselves. ‘They are dirty, black and stupid,’ people would say. ‘Let them be illiterate.’ All the teachers do is to keep the children quiet with a long stick, as they cannot imagine education will be any use to them. (p. 34)

Gujars and Kohistanis are victims of scorn due to their unlanded existence and traditional livelihoods. Even teachers believe the Gujars and Kohistanis do not require education, and are content with the generational poverty of others.

When he has children and a school of his own, Malala’s father provides free education for more than 100 children, but not all members of the community are happy to see poor students at the school. Malala explains:

> Some of the richer parents took their children out of the school when they realized they were sharing classrooms with the sons and daughters of people who cleaned their houses or stitched their clothes. They thought it was shameful for their children to mix with those from poor families. (p. 67)

Some wealthy families consider the presence of poor people such a degradation, that they insist on educational segregation.

# Skin Color

Colorism harms both Malala and her father before her. Malala’s father, while privileged as a boy, suffers because of people’s reactions to his skin color. Malala describes her father’s experiences as a boy: “...he was insecure about his looks because at school the teachers always favored the handsome boys for their fair skin. His cousins would stop my father on his way home from school and tease him about being short and dark skinned” (p. 28). Blatant partiality for light skin, exhibited to Ziauddin by educators and family members, damages his confidence. Malala writes that Ziauddin:

> ...had been so self-conscious about being dark-skinned that he used to go to the fields to get buffalo milk to spread on his face, thinking it would make him lighter. It was only when he met my mother that he became comfortable in his own skin. Being loved by such a beautiful girl gave him confidence. (p. 15)

Ziauddin’s hard work, intellect, and character are not enough to reassure him of his value. Instead, his self-worth improves only because a woman with light skin deems him worthy.

Malala absorbs her culture’s desire for light skin. She shares, “I wished I had [my mother’s] white-lily skin, fine features and green eyes, but instead had inherited the sallow complexion, wide nose and brown eyes of my father” (p. 15). As a fifteen-year-old, Malala uses cream to whiten her skin. She recalls an exchange with a friend:


> Moniba was looking very beautiful, her skin porcelain-pale. ‘What skin cream are you using?’ I ask her. ‘The same one you’re using,’ she replied. I knew that could not be true. ‘No. Look at my dark skin and look at yours!’ (p. 190)

Malala disparages her natural skin color, and tries to lighten her complexion, just as her father did. Ziauddin suffers because of his environment’s definition of beauty, and he is unable to save his daughter from the same experience.

Although the title of Malala’s book highlights the injustice of the Taliban, and the struggle of girls, her book reveals the injustice of general Pakistan, and discrimination against more than one group of people.
