Beverly Daniel Tatum is an American educator, administrator, clinical
psychologist, and author of the 2017 book, _Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting
Together In the Cafeteria?_ Her book title, she relates, is based on the most
common question she gets from people all over the country. Dr. Tatum explains
that Black students often sit together in the cafeteria because in a culture
that constantly reminders of their race, Black students find safety and support
by sitting with other members of their racial group.

Dr. Tatum suggests that the more important questions we should be asking
ourselves are, “What does it mean to be Black?” and “What does it mean to be
White?” Hopefully the more we learn and talk about race, the more comfortable
the topic becomes.

### Some Ideas

1. Stereotypes about marginalized groups are often based not on what people have
been exposed to, but what they have not been exposed to. Black figures,
literature, and art, for example, are often underrepresented in curricula,
television, advertisements, etc.

   Because positive images of marginalized groups are not pervasive in
   mainstream culture, people may not be exposed to positive images of
   marginalized groups unless they actively seek them. In order to have a
   comprehensive understanding of society we must seek to know more about all
   groups, not just the dominant group.

2. Along with race, there are other social categories in which people find
themselves either in the dominant or subordinate status. Class, gender, ability
(mental and physical), and religion, are several characteristics that affect our
experience in society. An individual may be targeted by multiple isms -
classism, sexism, ableism, anti-Semitism - making their marginized experience in
society more intense.

   White people who identify strongly with another subordinate status may feel that
   their Whiteness is less meaningful. For example, European Jews, White members of
   the LGBTQ community, or White people who grew up poor, may struggle with the
   idea that they are privileged in any way.

   Many people occupy a combination of dominant and subordinate statuses. If we
   draw on our own experiences of subordination, we may be better able to empathize
   with another targeted group’s experience.

3. We shouldn’t try to be “color-blind.” A perspective that doesn’t recognize the
significance of race overlooks the disparate histories of the races and denies
that Black people have a different experience in society than White people.

   Acknowledging the privileges associated with being White, and the disadvantages
   associated with being Black, is necessary to breaking the cycle of racism.

4. We need to speak up. If we see or hear injustice, we need to address it. When we
allow demeaning comments or jokes to go unchallenged, for example, our silence
serves as collusion.

   We should all feel confident and obliged to simply say, “That’s not cool.” when
   we recognize unfairness. One individual speaking up can have powerful effects on
   norms in friend groups, families, schools or work places, and thus society in
   general.
