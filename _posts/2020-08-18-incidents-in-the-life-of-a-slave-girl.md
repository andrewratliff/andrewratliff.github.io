_Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl_ (2016), depicts Harriet Jacobs’s life as an enslaved black woman in the 19th century United States. Born in 1813, Jacobs spends her childhood and young adulthood in slavery. Later in her life, as a free woman in the North, Jacobs reflects on the realities of enslaved black women and mixed-race children. She also highlights the reasons that enslaved people have to endure, rather than try to escape, the terror of slavery.

# Enslaved Women

Jacobs insists, “Slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more terrible for women. Superadded to the burden common to all, _they_ have wrongs, and sufferings, and mortifications peculiarly their own” (p. 71). Jacobs refers to the violations, from sexual harassment to rape, that enslaved black women sustain. Jacobs explains how the abuse begins:


> When she is fourteen or fifteen, her owner, or his sons, or the overseer, or perhaps all of them, begin to bribe her with presents. If these fail to accomplish their purpose, she is whipped or starved into submission to their will. (p. 46)

Jacobs expresses that the enslaved women have very little power to evade predation. The women have no protection against verbal manipulation or physical violence. Harriet’s own white enslaver, Dr. Flint (as she calls him in her autobiography), begins to sexually harass her when she is fifteen years old.

Enslaved black women are also vulnerable to the white wives of their enslavers. Dr. Flint’s wife confronts Harriet, and Harriet honestly discloses Dr. Flint’s behavior towards her. Harriet reveals how Mrs. Flint reacts:


> [Mrs. Flint] felt that her marriage vows were desecrated, her dignity insulted; but she had no compassion for the poor victim of her husband’s perfidy. She pitied herself as a martyr; but she was incapable of feeling for the condition of shame and misery in which her unfortunate, helpless slave was placed. (p. 28)

Mrs. Flint focuses on her own wounded pride, and tarnished marriage, rather than the exploitation of Harriet, and the injustice of slavery. However, Harriet believes that Mrs. Flint responds predictably, for Harriet argues that typically, “The mistress, who ought to protect the helpless victim, has no other feelings towards [the slave girl] but those of jealousy and rage” (p. 23). Harriet, like many other enslaved black women, becomes caught between the unwanted attention of the white man and woman that bind her.

# Mixed-race Children

To Harriet’s knowledge, Dr. Flint fathers more than ten children born to different black women he enslaves (p. 30). Dr. Flint’s mixed-race children, however, do not inherit his free, white status. Instead, the children are born into slavery. Harriet understands: “...for slaveholders have been cunning enough to enact that ‘the child shall follow the condition of the mother,’ not the father, thus taking care that licentiousness shall not interfere with avarice” (p. 70). The law that children born to enslaved mothers are also enslaved, accommodates white, male enslavers. Not only will a white man lose money if he frees his mixed-race child, he also pays a social price:


> At the south, a gentleman may have a shoal of colored children without any disgrace; but if he…[sets] them free, the example is thought to be dangerous to their ‘peculiar institution,’ and he becomes unpopular. (p. 118)

Thus, the mixed-race children of enslaved mothers are necessarily born into slavery, with little hope of freedom.

The wives of enslavers generally take offense to mixed-race children on their properties, and demand the sale of mixed-race children. The wives pass their husbands’ children, “...into the slave-trader’s hands as soon as possible, and thus [get] them out of their sight” (p. 31). Specifically in the case of Dr. and Mrs. Flint, Harriet professes: “[Dr. Flint] never allowed his offspring by slaves to remain long in sight of himself and his wife” (p. 39). When they must leave their other family members for a new plantation, mixed-race children suffer for the crimes of their fathers.

# Escape

Jacobs discusses just a few of the many reasons enslaved people have to stay where they are. If they attempt to escape, enslaved people risk their lives, and the lives of their family members and friends that they leave behind. When Harriet decides she must flee, Dr. Flint abuses her family:


> My brother William and the good aunt who had served in his family twenty years, and my little Benny, and Ellen who was a little over two years old, were thrust into jail, as a means of compelling my relatives to give some information about me. He swore my grandmother should never see one of them again till I was brought back. (p. 95)

Dr. Flint places older people and young children in the confines of a cell, where they remain for months. He also promises five hundred lashes to any black person on his property involved in Harriet’s escape.

Neither an escape to the North, nor a legally free status guarantees protection for black people. Harriet knows that sometimes, “...when victims make their escape from the wild beast of Slavery, Northerners consent to act the part of the bloodhounds, and hunt the poor fugitive back into his den…” (p. 30). Even when black people are legally free, many others do not honor that status. Harriet’s grandmother obtains her freedom as a child, and with other free family members, she tries to leave South Carolina. However, “...they were captured on their passage, carried back, and sold to different purchasers” (p. 1). Once on another Southern plantation, Harriet’s grandmother has no way to enforce her liberty. As Jacobs’s autobiography illustrates, the common practices of the 19th century impede an enslaved person’s ability to acquire and maintain freedom.
