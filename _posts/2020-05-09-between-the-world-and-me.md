In his 2015 open letter, _Between the World and Me_, author and journalist,
[Ta-Nehisi Coates][1]{:target="_blank"}, writes to his teenage son about what it
means to be black in the United States. Mr. Coates tells his son that he has
many privileges, but that life in a black body remains dangerous.

Physical violence against black people is Mr. Coates’s greatest concern. He
suggests that all of the country’s contemporary, nuanced language to describe
various race-based issues distracts focus from the most
fundamental problem of violence. Whether the aggressor is white, black, or any
other race, much of the violence against black people stems from the same
history of racism.

Mr. Coates warns his son that black people do not receive the same tolerance
as white people when they make mistakes - whether those mistakes are real or
imagined. He writes, “...the price of error is higher for you than it is for
your countrymen...our errors always cost us more” (pp. 95-96). Mr. Coates cites
the 2012 murder of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida, and the 2014 police shooting of twelve-year-old Tamir Rice in an Ohio park. He recalls the murder of Renisha McBride in Michigan, and the beating of Marlene Pinnock in California. He references Eric Garner, John Crawford, and Michael Brown, black men that police officers kill in 2014.

Despite an environment that is often hostile against black people, Mr. Coates
does not want his son to feel as though he needs to change himself. He laments
the black parents that are so afraid for their children, they “tell their
black boys and girls to ‘be twice as good’” (p. 90), when the burden of change
does not belong to black children. Mr. Coates encourages his son to find his way as an
individual, without constraints. He tells his son, “You are growing into
consciousness, and my wish for you is that you feel no need to constrict
yourself to make other people comfortable” (p. 107). The mother of one murdered black boy reinforces, more specifically, Mr. Coates’s
own feelings. She stresses to Mr. Coates’s son:

> You exist. You matter. You have value. You have every right to wear your
> hoodie, to play your music as loud as you want. You have every right to be
> you. And no one should deter you from being you. You have to be you. And you
> can never be afraid to be you. (p. 113)
