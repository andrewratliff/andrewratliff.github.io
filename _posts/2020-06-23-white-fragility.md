In her 2018 book, _White Fragility_, Dr. Robin DiAngelo explains how white people can help interrupt racism in the United States. She urges white people to confront their own racism (overcome white fragility), and to challenge racism that other white people exhibit (break white solidarity).

# White Fragility

White fragility is the defensive reaction white people may have when another person points out a racially problematic aspect of their beliefs, words, or actions.

Dr. DiAngelo suggests that no one in the United States is completely free of racist ideas because racism is a product of American socialization. She encourages people to examine themselves and try to identify their own racist patterns, rather than try to deny any racism. White people are better allies when they listen to difficult feedback with humility and gratitude (p. 141).

# White Solidarity

White solidarity is upheld when a white person says or does something racially problematic, and other white people don't challenge that person. Dr. DiAngelo writes:

> We see white solidarity at the dinner table, at parties, and in work settings. Many of us can relate to the big family dinner at which Uncle Bob says something racially offensive. Everyone cringes but no one challenges him because nobody wants to ruin the dinner. Or the party where someone tells a racist joke but we keep silent because we don’t want to be accused of being too politically correct and be told to lighten up. In the workplace, we avoid naming racism for the same reasons, in addition to wanting to be seen as a team player and to avoid anything that may jeopardize our career advancement. (p. 58)

Dr. DiAngelo argues that white people may think, “I wasn’t the one who told that joke,” or “I don’t agree with that,” as a way to assure themselves they aren’t complicit. They also might think, “Uncle Bob isn’t a mean guy,” and try to excuse evident racism as unintentional or justifiable. Dr. DiAngelo stresses, however, that each unopposed comment, joke, or action, helps perpetuate racism (p. 58).

To break white solidarity, white people must hold each other accountable, whether someone's racism is deliberate or not (p. 125). Dr. DiAngelo shares that when she encounters racism from fellow white people, she tries to impart her perspective in a calm and concise way. She communicates what she thinks to people, even if she doesn’t expect to change their minds.

Listen to Dr. Robin DiAngelo talk about white fragility and racism in the United States.
